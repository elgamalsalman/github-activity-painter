### Description

This is an automatically daily runnable script that paints a pattern of choice from a png image onto your github activity bar! 

### Instructions

```
pip install numpy python-dotenv Pillow
```

### Provided Patterns

Patterns are images that has to be 7 pixels in height, but there are no limits on width since they'll be repeated anyways.

Find the extensive list of provided patterns [here](./patterns).

I'll leave you with my personal favourite though: Diagonal Bits Pattern
